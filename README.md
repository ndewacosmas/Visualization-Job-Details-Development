under this project all application which are applied in the system are visualized on this area of visualization in other words is called Dashboard all application of the proposed system will be updated every 1 min, and all data which are extracted from the source are updated every quarter

Home Pages, according to this project, author state that this area it used to staste the detail of the project

          topic: Batch Data Processing Application


          **PROCESS STATUS**

According to this project author use this area to provide clerification on how the system is executed.

 The image below show how the data are extracted from the source of Kaggle.com

![status process1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44784282-f777-4143-b224-740f1efe5ba8)
source: students-performance-in-exams

The column data contains subject score, gender of students, standard of students and other related information as mention in the table above

according of this project author state that this page can be used as a monitoring tool as it recorded all works of executions

.After the status ETL is displayed, the ETL prosess page will display the ETL results


. After the status ML is displayed, the Machine learning process page will display in ML Results


The author of this projects state that the update of this pages are updated every one minute and the result will be displayed in the dashboard


**ETL PROCESS**
This page shows the table created by the ETL job, according to this project author state that all data which are extracted from the source before transformed and loaded into the processing stages as in the table below

![ETL STATUS 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2376a5de-f94c-4f2b-87f8-97b8d4027c8b)
 
 The student performance of the examination was analysed by the use of the gender and performance score of the subject and aggregated by the country in a quarter and converted to standard of the student by looking in the percentages of the student.
The result of this area are shown into dashboard.

**MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS**
Machine Learning is the process used by System to make analysis of the data which are extracted from ETL microservices, this pages show that the table created are used to analyzes student performance in terms of gender and level of score in Machine learning work. the result which are found in the ETL are depending on the score of student in three subjects of Maths, Writing and reading in USA which are published in y 6 years ago.

![ML STATUS  2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d887c0f-89d5-439a-8240-c0e5284aa6b6)

according this project it show that most of the student scores are ranges 60-70 in math subject, scores ranges 66.8 -75.10  in reading subject and scores of 73-82 in writing subject.

not only that but also the score of student is ranges from 0-100 in math subject, 17-100 in reading subject and 10 - 100 in writing subject

In general it show that most of the student did not doing well in math subject if you compare with other subjects.
